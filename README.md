# Arduino Project MaTouch 5inch

## Prepare Arduino Library

Copy SquareLine_Project\libraries\lv_conf.h into the SquareLine_Project\libraries\lvgl\src folder.

Copy the libraries into C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\Documents\Arduino\libraries.

If these libraries already exist, delete them. And the ui folder must be deleted before copying.


## Compile the Arduino program

Open the .ino file in Arduino.

Please select the compilation options for MaTouch according to the Makerfabs wiki or github.

## Update the modified UI

The SquareLine UI code is now compiled in Arduino as a library.

Each time you select "Export UI Files", SquareLine will update the ui library in the SquareLine_Project\libraries\ui\ of the project by default.

You need to replace the ui library in C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\Documents\Arduino\libraries.

Or in Project Setting, redirect the UI export location, such as:

C:\Users\YOUR_USER_NAME\Documents\Arduino\libraries\ui\src


``` 

Use version 8.3.11 of the library lvgl 
Use version 1.3.1 of the library GFX_Library_for_Arduino 
Use version 2.0.0 library SPI 
Use version 1.0 of the library ui 
Use version 2.0.0 version of library Wire 
Use version 1.0.2 of the library TAMC_GT911 

```
